# decent-ra-server

## NOTE

We've noticed a change in the latest version of the build tool and a staled 3rd party library may cause the build process to fail. We're working on updating the dependency, and the fix will be released shortly.

## NOTE
- This repo is only created for the purpose of anonymity in paper submission.
- Submodule in `hunter` directory is pushed with source files directly, to avoid potential violation of anonymity caused by the link to the forked repos.
- The code has only been fully tested under *Windows 10* environment.
